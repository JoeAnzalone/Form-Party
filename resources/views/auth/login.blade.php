                    <p>You're looking at the internet's hottest new anonymous question and answer site. Folks from all over the tri-state area gather hereðŸ‘‡ to share secrets, confess their love, or just talk smack to their e-pals. ðŸ’Œ</p>

                    <p>It's like a party, with forms!</p>

                    <p>Form Party is currently invite-only and in beta, but anyone can send messages to current members (that's the whole point!)</p>

                    <p>If you're interested in setting up a form for yourself, you can try asking <a href="{{ route('profile', 'joe') }}">Joe</a>. (nicely)</p>
